# Modeling Stock Movement and Algorithmic Trading
Brian Bahmanyar

## Abstract

Understanding the movement of markets and stocks is fundamentally a very difficult problem. There are many factors that go into a comapany's valuation, which is reflected in the price of its stock. Another factor that effects a stock price at a given time is human behavior, if people think that a stock is overvalued they are likey to sell. When others holding stock with that comapany see that others are selling, and the price is dropping, they will then sell their shares. This then causes the stock to be undervalued and the cycle continues. In this project I will explore and model how stock prices move over time, and in relation to one another. Then I will use this information to implement and back test a pairs trading algorithm. The goal of this project will be to outpreform the Standard and Poor's 500 which historically yeilds an average return of about 10%.
